# Problem Statement
Pre-process the dataset for buliding the LINEAR REGRESSION MODEL and build the linear regression model to predict the sale price of the house.

This project is my assignment work for the training of MACHINE LEARNING with python by INTERNSHALA TRAINING.
# solution steps involved
 1. Analyze the given dataset and the different columns in it.
 2. Find out the descriptive statistics of the dataset.
 3. Check the presence of outliers.If any treat them using imputing or deletion methods.
 4. Check for the missing values in the  dataset and treat them.
 5. Using Feature Engineering create any variables if necessary.
 6. Convert Categorical variables to numeric uusing Binning or other methods.
 7. Check for Multi-Collinearity and remove variables which have Multi-Collinearity.
 8. Sepeate the dataset into Train and Test sets.
 9. Build the regression model.
10. Check the Accuray of the model.
